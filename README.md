# Learning-Based-Inertial-Sensing

This is a final project in the course "Learning Based Inertial Sensing" at the Technion, Israel.
This project aims to classify the road surface type which a car is driving upon.

The project is based on an existing research: 
J. Menegazzo and A. von Wangenheim, "Multi-Contextual and Multi-Aspect Analysis for Road Surface Type Classification Through Inertial Sensors and Deep Learning," 2020 X Brazilian Symposium on Computing Systems Engineering (SBESC), Florianopolis, 2020, pp. 1-8, doi: 10.1109/SBESC51047.2020.9277846.

We will explore various machine learning tricks to try to better our understanding and intuition on neural networks, and hopefully outperform the existing research on the matter.
